## Introduction

Set-up a Traefik v2 reverse proxy along with Portainer, using Docker Compose.

**Prerequisites**

- Ubuntu 20.04 server(or any distro you want)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Domain name

## Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/vitoyxyz/traefik-portainer.git
```

## Setting up DNS records

Alright so the first thing to do is setting up the appropiate domains so we can access our Portainer and Traefik dashboard.
Set them up like this, point to your server:

```
traefik.yourdomain.com
portainer.yourdomain.com
```

In this way our Portainer & Traefik dashboard will be available at the appropriate subdomains.

## File explanation

#### I. traefik.yml

The first file we will go over is the `traefik.yml` file as seen in the code snippet below. This is the static, base configuration of Traefik.

First we tell Traefik that we want the Web GUI by setting `dashboard:true`

After that we define our two entrypoints `web` (http) and `websecure` (https). For our secure `https` endpoint we set-up the `certResolver` so we can enjoy automatic certifcates from Let's Encrypt. Next up we load the appropriate middleware so that all our traffic will be forwarded to `https`.

In the `providers` part we specify that this file will be passed to a docker container using bind mount. We also tell Traefik to find our dynamic configuration in `configurations/dynamic.yml`. And at last is the configuration for our SSL certificate resolver.

```yml
# traefik.yml
api:
  dashboard: true

entryPoints:
  web:
    address: :80
    http:
      redirections:
        entryPoint:
          to: websecure

  websecure:
    address: :443
    http:
      middlewares:
        - secureHeaders@file
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt

providers:
  docker:
    endpoint: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
    exposedByDefault: false
  file:
    filename: /configurations/dynamic.yml

certificatesResolvers:
  letsencrypt:
    acme:
      email: raf@yourdomain.com
      storage: acme.json
      keyType: EC384
      httpChallenge:
        entryPoint: web
```

> **Note:** Make sure to configure an email in this file for the Let's Encrypt renewal. @yourdomain.com might throw an error when you want to run your docker container!

#### II. dynamic.yml

This file contains our middlewares to make sure all our traffic is fully secure and runs over TLS. We also set the basic auth here for our Traefik dashboard, because by default it is accessible for everyone.

The file is fully dynamic and can be edited on the fly, without restarting our container.

```yml
# dynamic.yml
http:
  middlewares:
    secureHeaders:
      headers:
        sslRedirect: true
        forceSTSHeader: true
        stsIncludeSubdomains: true
        stsPreload: true
        stsSeconds: 31536000

    user-auth:
      basicAuth:
        users:
          - "raf:$apr1$MTqfVwiE$FKkzT5ERGFqwH9f3uipxA1"

tls:
  options:
    default:
      cipherSuites:
        - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
        - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
        - TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305
      minVersion: VersionTLS12
```

#### III. docker-compose.yml

The most important file. So the beauty of Traefik is that once you have done the intial set-up, deploying new containers is very easy. It works by specifiying `labels` for your containers.

```yml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"

services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:latest
    container_name: traefik
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    networks:
      - proxy
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - ./traefik-data/traefik.yml:/traefik.yml:ro
      - ./traefik-data/acme.json:/acme.json
      - ./traefik-data/configurations:/configurations
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.docker.network=proxy"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik-secure.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik-secure.rule=Host(`traefik.yourdomain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik-secure.service=api@internal"
      - "traefik.http.routers.traefik-secure.middlewares=user-auth@file"

  portainer:
    image: portainer/portainer-ce:latest
    container_name: portainer
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    networks:
      - proxy
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - ./portainer-data:/data
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.docker.network=proxy"
      - "traefik.http.routers.portainer-secure.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.portainer-secure.rule=Host(`portainer.yourdomain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.portainer-secure.service=portainer"
      - "traefik.http.services.portainer.loadbalancer.server.port=9000"

networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
```

For every container that you want Traefik to handle, you add labels so Traefik knows where it should route it. So when we look at the file above, let's quickly check what is going on at the `traefik` container.

So we attach the first label, which tells Traefik that it should route this container because we specify `enable=true`. This is the result of the configuration in the static `traefik.yml` file where we explictly stated `exposedByDefault: false` so therefore we have to specify that.

The second label tells us that we should use the network `proxy`, which we will create later on. After that we tell Traefik to use our `websecure` endpoint (https). We then specify our host name with the appropriate domain.

The final to last label specifies the API handler. It exposes information such as the configuration of all routers, services, middlewares, etc. To see all the available endpoints you can check [the docs.](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v2.3/operations/api/#endpoints)

The very last label is our basic auth middleware. Because the Traefik dashboard is exposed by default so we add a basic security layer over it. It will also protect our API.

```yml
labels:
  - "traefik.enable=true"
  - "traefik.docker.network=proxy"
  - "traefik.http.routers.traefik-secure.entrypoints=websecure"
  - "traefik.http.routers.traefik-secure.rule=Host(`traefik.yourdomain.com`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.traefik-secure.service=api@internal"
  - "traefik.http.routers.traefik-secure.middlewares=user-auth@file"
```

## Running our stack

#### I. Creating credentials

So the first thing we should do is generate the password for basic auth that will be stored in the `dynamic.yml` file. These credentials will be required when trying to log into our Traefik Web UI and it will protect the API.

Make sure your server has `htpasswd` installed. If it doesn't you can do so with the following command or equivalent for your distro:

```
 sudo apt install apache-utils
```

Then run the below command, replacing the username and password with the one you want to use.

```
 echo $(htpasswd -nb <username> <password>)
```

Edit the `dynamic.yml` file and add your auth string under the `user-auth` middleware as seen in the example code.

#### II. Creating the proxy network

We need to create a new Docker network that will allow outside traffic. This should be called `proxy` as we specified in our `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
networks:
  - proxy
```

To create a docker network use:

```
 docker network create proxy
```

#### III. Editing the domain names

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and make sure you replace the domain values in the Traefik labels to the domains that you send to the server as done earlier:

```
traefik.yourdomain.com
portainer.yourdomain.com
```

#### IV. Giving the proper permissions to acme.json

By default the file acme.json has the permission set to `644`, this will result in a error when running `docker-compose`. So make sure you set the permissions of that particular file to `600`. `cd` into the `core` folder and run the following command:

```
 sudo chmod 600 ./traefik-config/acme.json
```

#### V. Running the stack

Now it is time to run the stack. On the first run I always like to check the process for errors before we use the docker-compose `--detach` flag. Run the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

Right now the Traefik dashboard should be available at `traefik.yourdomain.com` and `portainer.yourdomain.com`.

When you are sure that your containers are running correctly, run them in the background by using the `--detach` option:

```
docker-compose down && sudo docker-compose up -d
```
